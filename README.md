# ChatStats-for-Android
Android App for parsing WhatsApp-exported chat files and plotting fun statistics about word counts, activity timelines, vocabulary, etc.

Requires Minimum Android Lollipop (5.0)

Instruction for users: After compile and install, open WhatsApp, open a chat, press the three dots in the upper right corner, press "More", choose "Export Chat" and choose "Without Media". Then select the ChatStats app as a means of exporting the file. If the date-format and language is set correctly in the ChatsStats app, you should now be able to view your stats.

UPDATE: as of 11/2021 Should work again in Germany!!

Unfortunately, since April 2019, German WhatsApp users can no longer export their chats as txt files, due to GDPR. Thus ChatStats cannot fullfil its purpose for German users. Anywhere else in the world, it works.
